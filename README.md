<h1> Configure Virtual Network Connectivity by Using Peering </h1>
<br>

<h2>Understanding the Scenario</h2>

You are a Security Engineer for Hexelo, an organization that needs to configure secure bidirectional communication between Azure virtual networks.

In this Lab, you will configure virtual network connectivity by using peering.
1. First, you will create an Azure virtual network by using the Azure portal.
2. Next, you will create an Azure virtual network by using Azure Cloud Shell.
3. Finally, you will configure virtual network peering connections for secure bidirectional communication.
